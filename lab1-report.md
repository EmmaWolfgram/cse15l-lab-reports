cd commands:
```
[user@sahara ~]$ cd
```
no output, when running this command the user is in the home directory
There is no output for running cd with no arguments because when running cd you are changing the directory you are in.
With being in the home directory and then running cd, you are not changing the directory because you are already in the first directory.
Having no output in this case is not an error.

```
[user@sahara ~]$ cd lecture1
[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$
```
For cd with one argument, there is no specific output however, the beginning of the terminal line changes to show you that you are
now in the lecture1 directory. When the command was first run, I was in the home directory, and after running I was in the lecture1 directory.
The output is not an error.

```
[user@sahara ~]$ cd
